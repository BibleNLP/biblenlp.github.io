# About Us

We are a community of researchers and developers working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for biblical texts. We work across modalities, with text, audio, and visual data, with an emphasis on (ultra-)low resource languages. Our goal is to advance the state of the art in this field and make our tools and resources widely available.

Many of us are from the Bible translation community and are passionate about leveraging technology to improve access to biblical texts. But we have diverse backgrounds and expertise, including linguistics, computer science, and theology.
