PABNLP - Partnership for Applied Biblical NLP - is a pioneering initiative that seeks to bring together practitioners across organizations who are interested in Bible and theology and the use of Machine Learning. We seek to advance the data and tools that serve these ends and to provide thought leadership as the field develops.
