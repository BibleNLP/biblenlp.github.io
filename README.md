# PABNLP Public Site

The site is live at <https://biblenlp.github.io>

## Repository Purpose

This repo serves as the public-facing site for PABNLP, providing information about our work at the intersection of Bible, natural language processing (NLP), and Bible translation. Here, you'll find our public notes, resources, and updates on topics relevant to these fields. The site also offers guidance on how to get involved with our community and contribute to ongoing projects.

Refer to the [VitePress documentation](https://vitepress.dev/guide/) for details on configuring navigation and sidebar.

## How to Add a Page


To add a page:

1. Create a Markdown file in the `content/` directory. Name the file according to the desired URL (e.g., `about.md` for `/about`).
2. Edit `.vitepress/config.mts` to add your new page:
    - For navigation, add it to the `nav` array.
    - For sidebar, add it to the appropriate section in the `sidebar` object.
